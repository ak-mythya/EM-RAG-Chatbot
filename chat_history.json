So, if we imagine bringing Earth closer to the Sun, like halving the distance, the gravitational force between them would become much stronger.

Imagine swinging a ball on a string \u2013 to keep it from falling inwards when you shorten the string, you have to swing it faster, right?

Implications for Earth's Orbital Speed:** *   For a stable orbit, the gravitational force provides the centripetal force required to keep the Earth moving in a circular path around the Sun. The centripetal force (Fc) is given by:     Fc = m * v\u00b2 / r     Where:     *   m is the mass of the Earth     *   v is the orbital speed of the Earth     *   r is the orbital radius (distance between the Earth and the Sun) *   In a stable orbit, the gravitational force equals the centripetal force:     G * (M * m) / r\u00b2 = m * v\u00b2 / r  (where M is the mass of the Sun) *   We can simplify this equation to find the orbital speed (v):     v\u00b2 = (G * M) / r     v = \u221a(G * M / r) *   Now, let's see how the orbital speed changes when the distance is halved (r' = r/2). Let the new orbital speed be v':     v' = \u221a(G * M / r')     v' = \u221a(G * M / (r/2))     v' = \u221a(2 * G * M / r)     v' = \u221a2 * \u221a(G * M / r)     v' = \u221a2 * v *   This shows that if the distance between the Earth and the Sun is halved, the Earth's orbital speed would increase by a factor of **\u221a2** (approximately 1.414 times). **In Summary:** Halving the distance between the Earth and the Sun would: *   **Increase the Gravitational Force:** The gravitational force between the Earth and the Sun would become four times stronger. *   **Increase the Orbital Speed:** The Earth's orbital speed would increase by a factor of \u221a2.
