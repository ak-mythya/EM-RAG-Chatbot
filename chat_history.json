So, if we imagine bringing Earth closer to the Sun, like halving the distance, the gravitational force between them would become much stronger.  Think of it like this: gravity gets stronger the closer things are.  In fact, if you halve the distance, the gravitational force actually becomes four times as strong!  This is because gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance.\\n\\nNow, this much stronger gravitational pull has a big impact on Earth's orbital speed. To stay in orbit and not just get sucked into the Sun, Earth would have to zip around much faster.  Imagine swinging a ball on a string \u2013 to keep it from falling inwards when you shorten the string, you have to swing it faster, right?  Similarly, with the Sun's gravity pulling in much harder, Earth needs to move at a higher orbital speed to balance that pull and maintain a stable orbit.  Specifically, the orbital speed would increase by a factor of the square root of 2.
