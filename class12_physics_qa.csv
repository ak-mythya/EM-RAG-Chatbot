(a) 64.5

(b) 129

(c) 182.5

(d) 730","
**Solution:** From Kepler’s law, T2∝ R3

Therefore,

(a) (l/2)hr

(b) 1 hr

(c) 2 hr

(d) 4 hr","**Solution**

According to Kepler’s law, T2∝ R3

P is the point where the field is zero, and a unit mass is placed at P.

Applying Newton’s law of gravitation,

(Gm x 1)/x2 = (G4m x 1)/(r – x)2

x2/(r – x)2= ¼

x/(r – x)= ½

2x = r – x

x = r/3
