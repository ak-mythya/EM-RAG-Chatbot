B. (b) The ring comes to a complete stop
C. (c) Friction between the ring and the ground is to the left
D. (d) There is no friction between the ring and the ground","Let’s assume that friction between the ground and the ring gives no impulse during the collision with the ball. Using conservation of momentum along the x-axis we get that the CM of the ring will come to rest. Thus option A is correct. Secondly, the question tells us that the ball gets a velocity in the vertical direction, hence there must be an impulse in the vertical direction. There will be horizontal and a vertical impulse on the ring at the point of contact. These will have components along the tangent of the ring, which will provide angular impulses. Using angular impulse = change in angular momentum, we get =2cos300(1/2) -1sin300(1/2)=2(¼)(ω2 – ω1), note that we have assumed that the direction of angular velocities is the same before and after and since LHS of the above equation is positive  ω2 > ω1 so the ring must be slipping to right and hence the friction will be to the left as it will be opposite to the direction of motion. Thus option C is correct"
