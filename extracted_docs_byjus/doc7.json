        "question": "A piece of wood of mass 0.03 kg is dropped from the top of a 100 m height building. At the same time, a bullet of mass 0.02 Kg is fired vertically upward, with a velocity 100 m/s, from the ground. The bullet gets embedded in the wood. Then the maximum height to which the combined system reaches above the top of the building before falling below is (g = 10 m/s)",

        "answer": "D",
        "solution": "Suppose both collide at the point P after time t. Time taken for the particles to collide, t = d/vrel  = 100/100 = 1s. Speed of wood just before collision =gt = 10m/s. Speed of bullet just before collision v -gt = 100 -10 = 90 m/s. Before 0.03 kg ↓ 10 m/s, 0.02 kg ↑ 90 m/s. After ↑ v, 0.05 kg. Now, the conservation of linear momentum just before and after the collision -(0.03)(10) + (0.02)(90) = (0.05)v ⇒ v = 30 m/s. The maximum height reached by the body a = v2/2g = (30)2/2(10) = 45 m. (100 -h) = ½ gt2 = ½ x 10 x1 ⇒h = 95 m. Height above tower = 40 m. Answer: (d) 40 m"

So time taken to cross each other, t1 = 180/(50 x 103/3600) = [(18 x 18)/25] s. When the trains are moving in opposite direction, relative velocity is |v1 – (–v2 )| = 80 + 30 = 110 km hr–1.
