Applying conservation of momentum, the initial momentum of the bullet is equal to the sum of the final momentum of the plate M1 and the momentum of the second plate including the bullet. after piercing M. ∴ mV1 = M1V2 + (M2 + m)V2. 0.02V1 = 1 x V2 + (2.98 + 0.02)V2. 0.02V1 = 1 x V2 + 3V2. 0.02V1 = 1 x V2 + 3V2. V1 = 4 V2 /0.02. V1 = 200V2 ———-(1). Let the velocity of the bullet when it comes out of the first plate = V3. The momentum of the bullet on the first and the second plate is equal to the sum of the momentum of the second plate and the bullet. 0.02V3 = (0.02 + 2.980 V2) = 0.02 V3 = 3V2. V3= 150V2———-(2). Loss percentage in the initial velocity of the bullet when it is moving between m1 and m2 is expressed as the following. Loss % ={(V1 – V3)/V1 } x 100. Loss % = {(200V2 – 150V2 )/200V2 } x 100.

After both the particles have left from A, the particle on the left will have a velocity v and the particle on the right will have a velocity 2v. They will first meet at point B travelling L and 2L distance. After collision velocity will get interchanged, the body with velocity will travel with a velocity 2v now and the one having velocity 2v will travel with velocity v. So the next collision will happen at point D travelling 2L distance and L distance. Again the velocity will get interchanged and they will collide at point A again.

Since the collision is elastic, total kinetic energy will be equal. Therefore, ½ x 1 x u2 = ½ x 1 x 22 + ½ x 5 x v2. u2 = 4 + 5v2. (-2 + 5v)2 = 4 + 5v2. 4 – 20v + 25v2 = 0. -20v + 20v2 =0. -20v (1-v) =0. v = 1m/s. Thus, u=3m/s. The velocity of the centres of mass of the combined system Vcm = ( m1v1+ m2v2)/(m1+m2).
