When the ultraviolet light is replaced by X-rays, both V0 and Kmax increase. Statement-2: Photoelectrons are emitted with speeds ranging from zero to a maximum value because of the range of frequencies present in the incident light.",

        "solution": "According to Einstein’s photoelectric equation. Kmax = hf – Φ0. where, f = frequency of incident light. Φ0 = work function of the metal. Since the frequency of ultraviolet light is less than the frequency of x-rays, the energy of the photon will be more than x-rays. Since Kmax = eV0. V0 = (hf/e) – (Φ0/e). As fX-rays > fUltraviolet. Therefore, both Kmax and V0 increase when ultraviolet light is replaced by X-rays. Statement-2 is false. Answer: (a) Statement-1 is true, Statement-2 is false"
