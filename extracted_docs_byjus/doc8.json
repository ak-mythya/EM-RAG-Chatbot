        "solution": "The rocket moves in the direction of the left ball. For the ball thrown from the left end u1=0.3 m/s. Therefore the relative acceleration a1 = -2m/s2. Let us consider S1=x and t1= t. Since, S1 = u1t1 + ½ a1t12. Therefore x = 0.3t – (½)x 2t2. x = 0.3t – t2 ——–(1). For the ball thrown from the right end u2=0.2 m/s. Therefore the relative acceleration a2 = 2m/s2. Let us consider S2=4-x and t2= t. Since, S2 = u2t2 + ½ a2t22. Therefore 4-x = 0.2t – ½ 2t2 ——–(2). Substituting the value of x from equa (1) in equa (2) we get. 4 – (0.3t – t2) = 0.2t +t2. 4 – 0.3t+t2 = 0.2t+t2. 4 = 0.5t. t = 4/0.5 = 8 sec"
