Thus, the frequency of the EM wave when it passes from vacuum to dielectric medium will not change. The velocity of the EM wave in vacuum is given by, c = 1/√μ0ε0. If n is the frequency of the wave and λ is the wavelength of the wave, then c=nλ. Thus, c = 1/√μ0ε0 = nλ, n = c/λ ——-(1). Now, the Velocity of the electromagnetic wave in the medium is given by; vmedium=1/(√(μ0ε0μrεr)). Since, c=1/√μ0ε0, Therefore, vmedium=c/√μrϵr. For dielectric medium, μr=1, Thus, vmedium=c/√εr. Now, vmedium=c/√4, vmedium=c/2. Since, frequency does not change, thus, vmedium=n×λmedium, c/2=n×λmedium, ⇒ν=c/(2λmedium) …………(2), From (1) and (2) we get; c/λ=c/2λmedium, λmedium=λ/2"
