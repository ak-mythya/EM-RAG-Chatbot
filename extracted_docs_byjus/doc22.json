At t = 0, the number of radioactive particles emitted is 1600 i.e., N0 = 1600. At t = 8 seconds,  the number of radioactive particles emitted are 100 i.e., N= 100. λ (8) = log (1600/100). λ (8) = log 16. λ (8) = log 24. λ (8) = 4log 2. λ  = (log 2) /2. We have to find the number of radioactive particles emitting at t = 6 seconds. Therefore, λt = log (N0/N ). 3 log 2 = log (1600/N). log 23= log (1600/N). log 8 = log (1600/N). 8 = (1600/N). N = 200"
