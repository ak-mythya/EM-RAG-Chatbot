        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "solution": "The moment of inertia of the system about the axis of rotation O is I = I1 + I2 = (0.3)x^2 + 0.7 (1.4 -x)^2. I = 0.3x^2+ 0.7(1.96 + x^2– 2.8 x) = 0.3x^2+ 1.372 + 0.7x^2– 1.96 x = x^2 + 1.372 – 1.96x. The work done in rotating the rod is converted into its rotational kinetic energy. W = ½ Iω^2 = ½[x^2 + 1.372 – 1.96x]ω^2. For the work done to be minimum dW/dx = 0 ⇒2x – 1.96 =0. x = 1.96/2 = 0.98m. Therefore, the correct answer is 0.98m from the mass of 0.3kg."

        "answer": "B",
        "solution": "L is not conserved in magnitude since v is changing (decreasing). It is given that a particle is confined to rotate in a circular path, it cannot have a spiral path. Since the particle has two accelerations ac and at therefore the net acceleration is not towards the centre. The direction of L remains the same even when the speed decreases."

        "answer": "D",
        "solution": "This is the case of vertical motion when the body just completes the circle. Here v = √(5gL). Applying energy conservation, ½ mv0^2 = ½ mv^2 + mgl(1-cosθ)———-(1), where v0 is the horizontal velocity at the bottom point, v is the velocity of bob where the bob inclined θ with vertical. Also, we know the relation between the velocity at the topmost and velocity at the bottom point. mg(2l) =½ mv0^2 -1/2mvtop^2———-(2). Since v0 is just sufficient mvtop^2/l = T + mg, T = 0, v_top=√(gl). Then equation 2 becomes v_0=√(5gl). According to the question v= v0/2. So from equation (1), ½ m(5gl) = ½ m (5gl/4) + mgl(1-cosθ), (20mgl – 5mgl)/8 = mgl(1-cosθ), (1-cosθ) = 15/8, Cosθ = ⅞. Hence, 3π/2 < θ < π"

        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "solution": "Let’s assume that friction between the ground and the ring gives no impulse during the collision with the ball. Using conservation of momentum along the x-axis we get that the CM of the ring will come to rest. Thus option A is correct. Secondly, the question tells us that the ball gets a velocity in the vertical direction, hence there must be an impulse in the vertical direction. There will be horizontal and a vertical impulse on the ring at the point of contact. These will have components along the tangent of the ring, which will provide angular impulses. Using angular impulse = change in angular momentum, we get =2cos300(1/2) -1sin300(1/2)=2(¼)(ω2 – ω1), note that we have assumed that the direction of angular velocities is the same before and after and since LHS of the above equation is positive  ω2 > ω1 so the ring must be slipping to right and hence the friction will be to the left as it will be opposite to the direction of motion. Thus option C is correct"
