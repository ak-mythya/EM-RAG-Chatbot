        "solution": "The forces acting on the solid ball when it is falling through a liquid is “mg” downwards, thrust by Archimedes principle upwards and the force due to the force of friction also acting upwards. The viscous force rapidly increases with velocity, attaining a maximum when the ball reaches the terminal velocity. Then the acceleration is zero. mg – Vρ2g – kvt2 = ma where V is volume, vt is the terminal velocity. When the ball is moving with terminal velocity, a = 0.
