        "question": "During peddling of a bicycle, the force of friction exerted by the ground on the two wheels is such that it acts",
        "options": [
          "A. in the backward direction on the front wheel and in the forward direction on the rear wheel",
          "B. in the forward direction on the front wheel and in the backward direction on the rear wheel",

          "D. in the forward direction on both, the front and the rear wheels."
        ],
        "answer": "A",
        "solution": "Due to peddling, the point of contact of the rear wheel has a tendency to move backwards. So frictional force opposes the backwards tendency i.e., the frictional force acts in the forward direction. But the back wheel accelerates the front wheel in the forward direction. To oppose this frictional force acts in the backward direction on the front wheel."
