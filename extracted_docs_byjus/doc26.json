        ],
        "answer": "D",
        "solution": "The measured distance by the student is 3.50 cm which means the least count of the measurement done is 0.01 cm. The least count of a vernier calliper which has 10 divisions in 1cm on the main scale and 10 divisions in vernier scale match with 9 division in the main scale can be given as 1 cm/(10 x 10) = 0.01 cm. Therefore, the student must have used the vernier calliper for the measurement"
